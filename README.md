# my-first-data-science-project
This is my first ever data science project! However, it's technically a data analysis project.

This project is all about analyzing the Google Play and App Store markets and developing an app profile recommendation for a company who creates free mobile apps intended for an English-speaking audience. They deploy these apps on Google Play and the App Store.
