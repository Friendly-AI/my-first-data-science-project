    "For this project, I'll pretend that I'm working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our company only builds apps that are designed for an English-speaking audience. They are also free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app &mdash; the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what types of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish my goal, I'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.\n",

To avoid spending resources on collecting new data, I'll try to find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for my goal:\n",

    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 **Android** apps from **Google Play**; the data was collected in August 2018 (you can download the data set directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv))\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 **iOS** apps from the **App Store**; the data was collected in July 2017 (you can download the data set directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv))\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll start by opening and exploring these two data sets. Before doing that though, to make the two data sets easier to explore, I'll create a function named `explore_data()` that I can repeatedly use to print rows of data in a readable way. In addition, when I use this function, I'll have the option to output the number of rows and columns in the data set."
